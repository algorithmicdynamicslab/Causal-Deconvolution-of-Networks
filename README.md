# Algorithmic Causal Deconvolution of Networks by Generative Mechanism

This repository contains the [R Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) code of the online application for causal deconvolution of networks by generative mechanism by the [Algorithmic Dynamics Lab](https://www.algorithmicdynamics.net/) and the [Algorithmic Nature Group](https://algorithmicnature.org/). The application is live at [this website](http://www.complexitycalculator.com/deconvolution).
